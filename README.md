# Battleship game

This project showcases an implementation of the classic game 'Battleship'. The game is built using the Test Driven Development (TDD) approach, which emphasizes incremental development and testing.

If you are unfamiliar with Battleship, it is a strategic board game where players place ships on a grid and take turns guessing the locations of their opponent's ships. You can find a description of the game here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)

In this project, the focus is on demonstrating the TDD process rather than testing the appearance of a webpage. Therefore, the project separates the application functionality from the actual DOM manipulation aspects. By employing mocks, the code ensures the proper interaction with DOM methods while keeping the core application logic clean and decoupled.

This Battleship implementation serves as a practical example of applying TDD principles to develop a game. It showcases the step-by-step development process and encourages developers to practice TDD in their own projects.

Feel free to explore the code and follow the commit history to see the progression of the game's development. Enjoy the experience of playing and learning from this Battleship project!
